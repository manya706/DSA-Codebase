# My coding playground!
Welcome to my personal repository for data structures and algorithms! This repository serves as my coding playground, where I organize and implement various algorithms and data structures for personal learning and practice.

## Directory Structure
- .vscode: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
- 100_DAYS_OF_CODE: Code snippets and solutions related to my "100 Days of Code" challenge. (interview prep so didn't follow through)
- CSES_Problem_set/Introductory_problems: Solutions to introductory problems from the CSES Problem Set.
- GFG Problems: Implementations of algorithms and data structures related to problems on GeeksforGeeks. (Hard, Medium, Easy) [Majorly used for interview prep @Goldman Sach, @Microsoft & @Flipkart]
- TLE-SHEET: Working on getting better at competitive programming.
